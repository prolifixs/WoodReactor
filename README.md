# WoodReactor Control Panel

## Overview
WoodReactor is a web-based control panel interface designed to monitor and control a wood gasification system. The application provides real-time monitoring and control capabilities for a wood gasifier, facilitating the conversion of wood biomass into combustible gas through thermochemical processes.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (React/Next.js)
- **WoodReactor Component**: Main container component that orchestrates the entire control panel interface
- **ControlGrid Component**: Manages the layout and organization of various control parameters and monitoring cards
- **Parameter Controls**: Interface elements for adjusting gasification parameters such as:
  - Temperature controls
  - Air flow rates
  - Pressure monitoring
  - Moisture content
  - Feed rate adjustments

### Backend/Hardware Integration
- Microcontroller integration for:
  - Data collection from sensors
  - Real-time process monitoring
  - Control signal transmission
  - System state management

## Features

### Real-time Monitoring
- Temperature readings across different zones
- Pressure measurements
- Gas composition analysis
- System status indicators

### Process Control
- Parameter adjustment capabilities
- Emergency shutdown controls
- Performance optimization settings
- System state management

### Data Management
- Historical data logging
- Performance analytics
- System health monitoring
- Alert and notification system

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 13+ (React framework)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern React patterns (hooks, context)
- Responsive design for multiple device support

### Communication
- WebSocket/HTTP protocols for real-time data
- Secure communication channels
- Robust error handling
- Data validation and sanitization

## Component Structure

### `WoodReactor` (Main Component)
Primary container managing the overall application state and layout.
- Handles main system state
- Coordinates between different sub-components
- Manages communication with the microcontroller

### `ControlGrid`
Organizes and displays control interfaces and monitoring panels.
- Responsive grid layout
- Dynamic card system for different controls
- Parameter adjustment interface

### Parameter Management
- Type-safe parameter handling
- Validation of input values
- Real-time update capability
- Preset management

## Safety Features
- Input validation and bounds checking
- Emergency shutdown capabilities
- Error state handling
- System status monitoring
- Alert system for critical conditions
